# Handling Jira stories for a release

Handling Jira stories for a release involves a systematic approach to manage and organize the tasks associated with a release.<br>

**Create a Release Version in Jira:**

-In Jira, create a version or fix version that represents the release. This can be done in the project settings or during issue creation.

**Link Stories to the Release:**

-Associate each user story or task with the corresponding release version. You can do this by setting the Fix Version field when creating or editing an issue.

**Prioritize Stories for the Release:**

Use the Jira backlog to prioritize the user stories that need to be included in the release. The order of the backlog determines the priority of work.

**Use Epics for High-Level Themes:**

If your project uses Epics in Jira, associate stories with relevant Epics. Epics provide a higher-level view of the themes or features being worked on.

**Plan Sprints:**

If you're using an Agile methodology, plan sprints that align with the release timeline. Assign stories to these sprints based on their priority.

**Track Progress:**

Regularly update the progress of each story. Use Jira boards (Scrum or Kanban boards) to visualize the progress of stories in relation to the release.

**Use Jira Release Reports:**

Take advantage of Jira's release reports to track progress and identify potential issues. Release Burndown charts, Velocity charts, and Cumulative Flow diagrams can provide valuable insights.

**Communicate Changes and Updates:**

Use Jira's commenting features to communicate changes, updates, and blockers related to the release. Keep the team informed of any adjustments to the release plan.

**Perform Regular Reviews:**

Conduct regular reviews of the release plan and adjust priorities if necessary. This helps in responding to changes and ensures that the most valuable features are delivered.

**Testing and Quality Assurance:**

Ensure that testing is integrated into the release process. Track the status of testing tasks, and use Jira to manage and track any identified issues or bugs.

**Document Release Notes:**

As features are completed, update and maintain release notes in Jira. Include information on new features, enhancements, and any known issues.

**Approve and Close Stories:**

Once stories are completed, reviewed, and tested, ensure that they are approved and closed in Jira. This helps in maintaining an accurate view of the release status.

**Release the Version:**

When all the planned work for the release is complete, release the version in Jira. This action can trigger notifications and mark the completion of the release.
